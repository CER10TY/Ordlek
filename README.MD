### OVERVIEW
This game is based around challenging the user with a random word, which is 'cut in half' at a certain spot.
The user has to guess the word and gets points based on the length of the word, if guessed correctly.

### WORD LISTS ARE PRE-DEFINED
The file ordlista.txt includes 815 words. In theory you could replace these 815 words with your own, as long as the file is still named ordlista.txt. The program will be able to read them.
